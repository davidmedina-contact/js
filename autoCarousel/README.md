#Auto Carousel

##This carousel scrolls through items in the HTML sideways.

**Features:**

+ It automatically adjusts items to fit as much as possible inside the container.
+ It's liquid. If the container flexes, it will adjust items. Try it yourself by dragging the bright blue borders at each side of the carousel.
+ Option to multiply the scrolling of items by a fixed number.
+ Ability to give an infinite illusion by cycling items endelsly.
+ Also you can change the scrolling speed.

###JS plugin options:

+ **option:** Amount of items to scroll per cycle. *Default: 1*
+ **scrollSpeed:** Scrolling speed (in seconds). *Default: 0.5*
+ **infinite:** Makes the carousel an endless cycle. *Default: false [other: true]*
+ **minGap:** Minimum allowed gap between items (in pixels). *Default: 5*
